# We want our source tree on the include path, along with pre-built ulib and
# krmllib so that F* can reuse these build artifacts rather than reverify F* and
# krmllib as part of this build (which would be doomed to fail since there's a
# lot of trickery involved in building ulib -- better leave it up to the F*
# build!).
#
# Also note that we have our own directory on the include path for the sake of
# the interactive mode, for finding checked files for our own F* files.
