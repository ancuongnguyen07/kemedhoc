## Thesis Writting
- Issues:
  - Inconsistence in fonts
  - [x] Intro should cover more general fields for broader audiences:
    - Types of protocol: AKE. Build up information for any CS students can understand.
    - Purpose for EDHOC, why it is needed? Point out OSCORE roles
  - [x] EDHOC message flows, get rid of big indention of `description` environment
  - [x] Make section 3 as known as the preliminary.
  - Explitly point out research gaps which are correspondingly resolved by the mentioned contributions (bullet points).
  - [x] EDHOC and DTLS is a weird paragraph title: make it into a separate subsection
  - Figure 4 and 6, 8 too big, do not auto scalling: redraw figure 4-6 to make their fonts consistent to the text in thesis.
  - [x] Line numbers of code snippets should be within margin. Try to avoid splitting code listing in several pages.
  - Limitations could be placed after `Contributions`.
  - [x] **Fix the KEMEDHOC protocol**: missing `ct_auth_I` in msg2, change `ptx1` into `(C_I,ID_CRED_I,EAD_1)`. Fix `ptx2` and `ptx3` using `()` instead of `||`
  - [ ] Table 14: Comparision to EDHOC's properties and other competitors.
  - [ ] Code listings: resize, make text smaller.
  - [ ] Listing 15: caption, ending is too short.
  - [ ] Ending at some paragraphs are too short.
  - [ ] Thesis Title: `Lightweight KEX` should be included.
- [ ] Introduction:
  - [x] `Contribution` should be 2x-3x longer.
  - [x] Approach

- [x] Premilinaries: `$\mathtt{ID}\_\mathtt{CRED}_R$` for distinct fonts from normal text. Splitting long paragraph into small chunks.
