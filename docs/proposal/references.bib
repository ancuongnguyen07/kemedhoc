abstract={Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) is designed to be a compact and lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol, providing mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and identity protection. EDHOC aims at being suitable for low-power networks such as cellular IoT, 6TiSCH, and LoRaWAN. In this paper, we perform a security analysis of the last draft of EDHOC (draft {\$}{\$}23{\$}{\$}23). We analyse the full protocol including its four different authentication methods. Our results show that the security of the authenticated key exchange in EDHOC depends essentially on that of the authenticated encryption algorithm used during that phase. Finally, we provide more precise estimates of the computational security bounds for all authentication methods in EDHOC so that meaningful choices of quantitative parameters can be done to instantiate the protocol securely.},

  abstract = {We introduce PQNoise, a post-quantum variant of the Noise framework. We demonstrate that it is possible to replace the Diffie-Hellman key-exchanges in Noise with KEMs in a secure way. A challenge is the inability to combine key pairs of KEMs, which can be resolved by certain forms of randomness-hardening for which we introduce a formal abstraction. We provide a generic recipe to turn classical Noise patterns into PQNoise patterns. We prove that the resulting PQNoise patterns achieve confidentiality and authenticity in the fACCE model. Moreover we show that for those classical Noise-patterns that have been conjectured or proven secure in the fACCE model our matching PQNoise patterns eventually achieve the same security. Our security proof is generic and applies to any valid PQNoise pattern. This is made possible by another abstraction, called a hash-object, which hides the exact workings of how keying material is processed in an abstract stateful object that outputs pseudorandom keys under different corruption patterns. We also show that the hash chains used in Noise are a secure hash-object. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of PQNoise delivering benchmarks for several base patterns.},

abstract = {The isogeny-based post-quantum schemes SIKE (NIST PQC round 3 alternate candidate) and CSIDH (Asiacrypt 2018) have received only little attention with respect to their fault attack resilience so far. We aim to fill this gap and provide a better understanding of their vulnerability by analyzing their resistance towards safe-error attacks. We present four safe-error attacks, two against SIKE and two against a constant-time implementation of CSIDH that uses dummy isogenies. The attacks use targeted bitflips during the respective isogeny-graph traversals. All four attacks lead to full key recovery. By using voltage and clock glitching, we physically carried out two of the attacks - one against each scheme -, thus demonstrate that full key recovery is also possible in practice.},

abstract = {Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as SVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the 'learning from parity with error' problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for SVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical.Using the main result, we obtain a public-key cryptosystem whose hardness is based on the worst-case quantum hardness of SVP and SIVP. Previous lattice-based public-key cryptosystems such as the one by Ajtai and Dwork were only based on unique-SVP, a special case of SVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous cryptosystems: the public key is of size \~{O}(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by \~{O}(n)(in previous cryptosystems these values are \~{O}(n4) and \~{O}(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \~{O}(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \~{O}(n).},

abstract={Most lattice-based cryptographic schemes are built upon the assumed hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems. Their efficiencies can be drastically improved by switching the hardness assumptions to the more compact Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. However, this change of hardness assumptions comes along with a possible security weakening: SIS and LWE are known to be at least as hard as standard (worst-case) problems on euclidean lattices, whereas Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE are only known to be as hard as their restrictions to special classes of ideal lattices, corresponding to ideals of some polynomial rings. In this work, we define the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, which bridge SIS with Ring-SIS, and LWE with Ring-LWE, respectively. We prove that these average-case problems are at least as hard as standard lattice problems restricted to module lattices (which themselves bridge arbitrary and ideal lattices). As these new problems enlarge the toolbox of the lattice-based cryptographer, they could prove useful for designing new schemes. Importantly, the worst-case to average-case reductions for the module problems are (qualitatively) sharp, in the sense that there exist converse reductions. This property is not known to hold in the context of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE: Ideal lattice problems could reveal easy without impacting the hardness of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE.},

abstract={{\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-based key-exchange protocols lie at the heart of post-quantum public-key cryptography. However, all existing protocols either lack the non-interactive nature of Diffie--Hellman key exchange or polynomial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-modulus, resulting in unwanted efficiency overhead. We study the possibility of designing non-interactive {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-based protocols with polynomial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-modulus. To this end, we identify and formalize simple non-interactive and polynomial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-modulus variants of the existing protocols, where Alice and Bob simultaneously exchange one or more (ring) {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}samples with polynomial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-modulus and then run individual key reconciliation functions to obtain the shared key. We point out central barriers and show that such non-interactive key-exchange protocols are impossible in either of the following cases: (1) the reconciliation functions first compute the inner product of the received {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}sample with their private {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}secret. This impossibility is information theoretic. (2) One of the reconciliation functions does not depend on the error of the transmitted {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}sample. This impossibility assumes hardness of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}. We show that progress toward either a polynomial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-modulus {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}NIKE{\}}{\$}{\$}construction or a general impossibility result has implications to the current understanding of lattice-based cryptographic constructions. Overall, our results show possibilities and challenges in designing simple (ring) {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}-based non-interactive key-exchange protocols.},

abstract = {The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a major application-layer protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). The recently standardized security protocol Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) efficiently provides end-to-end security of CoAP messages at the application layer, also in the presence of untrusted intermediaries. At the same time, CoAP supports one-to-many communication, targeting use cases such as smart lighting and building automation, firmware update, or emergency broadcast. Securing group communication for CoAP has additional challenges. It can be done using the novel Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) security protocol, which fulfills the same security requirements of OSCORE in group communication environments. While evaluations of OSCORE are available, no studies exist on the performance of Group OSCORE on resource-constrained IoT devices.This article presents the results of our extensive performance evaluation of Group OSCORE over two popular constrained IoT platforms, namely Zolertia Zoul and TI Simplelink. We have implemented Group OSCORE for the Contiki-NG operating system and made our implementation available as open source software. We compared Group OSCORE against unprotected CoAP as well as OSCORE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive and experimental evaluation of Group OSCORE over real constrained IoT devices.},

abstract = {A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure processing environment that is isolated from the normal processing environment where the device operating system and applications run. The first mobile phones with hardware-based TEEs appeared almost a decade ago, and today almost every smartphone and tablet contains a TEE like ARM TrustZone. Despite such a large-scale deployment, the use of TEE functionality has been limited for developers. With emerging standardization this situation is about to change. In this tutorial, we explain the security features provided by mobile TEEs and describe On-board Credentials (ObC) system that enables third-party TEE development. We discuss ongoing TEE standardization activities, including the recent Global Platform standards and the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification, and identify open problems for the near future of mobile hardware security.},
